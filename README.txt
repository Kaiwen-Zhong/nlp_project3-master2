Instructions on running this QA System

Everything is executed in Python 2.7.

Most runnable scripts take command line arguments. Their usage is displayed if incorrect arguments are specified.

BASELINE:

For the baseline, there are two versions; baseline.py is obsolete, while baseline_2.0.py is the one we used for part 1 and for comparison purposes in part 2.

There are three arguments: path to documents, path to questions, and path to answers.
The first should be the path to the "doc_dev" directory (in our case), and the last two are paths to the "question.txt" and "some_answer_file.txt," respectively.

FINAL SYSTEM:

First, we need to generate chunks before we can evaluate all our candidate answers. To do this, we execute chunk_generator.py.
There are seven arguments:
destination: The destination directory containing all relevant chunks.
question path: The path to question.txt.
documents path: The path to the documents (doc_dev or doc_test).
chunk size: The length (in words) of each of our chunks.
threshold: The fraction of keywords a chunk must contain in order to be a candidate chunk.
overwrite: If the directory specified by destination already exists, this option allows us to potentially overwrite its contents.
simple: This options signifies we want to use the "fast" chunking method (as described in the report).

Then, we generate the answer file using final.py.
We require three arguments. The first is the chunk path (path to directory generated by chunk_generator.py), and the paths to the question.txt and the answer file.
